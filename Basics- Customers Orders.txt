Come up with a query that lists the name and email of every customer followed by the item and price of orders they've made.
SELECT c.name, c.email, o.item, o.price
	FROM customers AS c
	LEFT OUTER JOIN orders AS o
	ON c.id = o.customer_id;
	
Create another query that will result in one row per each customer, with their name, 
email, and total amount of money they've spent on orders. Sort the rows according to 
the total money spent, from the most spent to the least spent.

SELECT c.name, c.email, SUM(o.price) AS spent
	FROM customers AS c
	LEFT OUTER JOIN orders AS o
	ON c.id = o.customer_id
	GROUP BY c.name
	ORDER BY spent DESC;

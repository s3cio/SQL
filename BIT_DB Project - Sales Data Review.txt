BIT_DB.sql is a sample dataset for an IT/Phone shop.   Sales data.

1. How many orders were placed in January?
   SELECT count(*) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales;
	   
     9723

2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
	
    Select count(*) from BIT_DB.JanSales 
    WHERE Product like "iPhone";
	
    379
  
3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
	  
    SELECT c.acctnum FROM BIT_DB.customers AS c
    INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales AS f
    ON c.order_id = f.orderID;
	
  	13618 results

4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price? For this one, you are going to use the commands distinct and MIN(). Using 'SELECT distinct' will remove duplicate rows from your results. The MIN() command will allow you to select the smallest value from the price column. This is a hard one - see if you can do it, but don't be afraid to look at the hint or answer if you need to!
	   
	SELECT Product, MIN(price) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales;
	Or
	SELECT distinct Product, price 
	FROM BIT_DB.JanSales 
	WHERE price in (SELECT min(price) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales);

	GROUP BY Product
	ORDER BY sum(Quantity)*price DESC;

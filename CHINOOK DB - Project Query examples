Here are some examples (below), of basic queries for this Music and Sales Database.


	1. Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US. (Hint: != or <> can be used to say "is not equal to").

    SELECT FirstName, LastName, Customerid, Country from chinook.customers
      WHERE Country != "USA";

	2. Show only the Customers from Brazil.
      
      SELECT FirstName, LastName, Customerid, Country from chinook.customers
      WHERE Country = "Brazil";

	3. Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country.
      
      SELECT cust.FirstName, cust.LastName, inv.Invoiceid, inv.InvoiceDate, inv.BillingCountry 
      FROM chinook.invoices AS inv
      LEFT JOIN chinook.customers AS cust
      ON inv.Customerid = cust.Customerid
      WHERE cust.Country = "Brazil";

	4. Show the Employees who are Sales Agents.
      
      SELECT FirstName, LastName, Title
      FROM chinook.employees
      WHERE title like "Sales%";

	5. Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table.

      SELECT distinct BillingCountry 
      FROM chinook.invoices;

	6. Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. The resulting table should include the Sales Agent's full name.

      SELECT emp.FirstName, emp.LastName, inv.InvoiceId
      FROM chinook.invoices AS inv
      LEFT JOIN chinook.customers AS cust
      ON inv.CustomerID = cust.CustomerId
      LEFT JOIN chinook.employees AS emp
      ON cust.SupportRepId = emp.EmployeeId;

	7. Show the Invoice Total, Customer name, Country, and Sales Agent name for all invoices and customers.

      SELECT inv.Total AS Inv_Total
          , cust.FirstName AS cust_FirstName
          , cust.LastName AS cust_LastName

	8. How many Invoices were there in 2009?

      SELECT count(InvoiceId) 
      FROM invoices
      WHERE InvoiceDate like "2009%";

      LEFT JOIN invoice_items AS invi
      ON inv.invoiceId = invi.InvoiceId
      LEFT JOIN tracks AS tr
      ON invi.TrackId = tr.TrackId
      ORDER BY InvoiceNum;

	11. Write a query that includes the purchased track name AND artist name with each invoice line item.

      SELECT inv.InvoiceId AS InvoiceNum
          , tr.Name AS TrackPurchased
          , art.Name AS artist_name
      FROM invoices AS inv
      LEFT JOIN invoice_items AS invi
      ON inv.invoiceId = invi.InvoiceId
      LEFT JOIN tracks AS tr
      ON invi.TrackId = tr.TrackId
	
      JOIN albums AS al
      ON al.AlbumId = tr.AlbumId

      ORDER BY round(sum(inv.Total),2) DESC
      LIMIT 1;
